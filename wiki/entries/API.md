# APIs



An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate with each other.



## Key Concepts

- **Endpoints**: Specific paths in an API that correspond to particular functions or data.

- **Requests and Responses**: APIs use requests to send data to a server and receive responses back.

- **REST and SOAP**: Two common architectural styles for APIs; REST is more commonly used in web services.



APIs are essential for enabling the integration of different services and applications. For more information, check out the [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) page.
